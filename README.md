1. Install requirements
2. Open ML.ipynb
3. Run all cells

This project includes two web implementations:

1. **Streamlit Version (app.py)**
   - Simple and interactive UI
   - Used for quick ML model deployment

2. **Flask Version (appflask.py)**
   - Uses HTML and CSS for custom frontend
   - Backend handled using Flask framework
